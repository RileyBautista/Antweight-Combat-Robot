# Antweight Combat Robot (no name yet)

### Day 1:
Realize I have absolutely no idea on what i'm doing

Research how combat robots even work 
 - [RC Electronics for Noobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j61Q3e8AFR4) (Helped me understand how everything actually functions with an RC controller)
 - [Introduction to Robot Combat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fyxuHzDUaY) (Got a better understanding of the rules and regulations)

Develop a preliminary BOM relying on supplies mainly from Fingertech Robotics
