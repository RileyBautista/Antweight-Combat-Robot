# Antweight Combat Robot (no name yet)
For Hack Club Highway!!!!

Very fun plastic antweight combat robot cause I want to learn!

This is one of my Highway projects because I loved doing robotics in FIRST from FLL to FTC but I also want to be more active in other robotics communities like combat robotics, which is why I want to try to make a plastic US Antweight to help me learn how to create better robots in the future and to compete in robotics tournaments near me like NRC or the House of Robotic Destruction both in my home state of Ohio!!!!!!
